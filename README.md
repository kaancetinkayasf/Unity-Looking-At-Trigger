# Unity-Looking-At-Trigger

This project demonstrates how the dot product in vector math can be used to determine if one of the two objects are looking towards the other or not. 

The reason why dot product is something we can make use of in this problem is that, it tells us how similar a given two vectors are. The vectors in our case are the direction to the npc from player and the local forward direction of the player.
